# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Have you ever wanted to eat a apple in a game that made you gain special abilites? Now you can

## Product
* I created a 2D platformer game using Kaboom.js where the player can collect different types of apples that grant special powers.

## Process
* I started by designing different levels using arrays of strings where each character represents different game elements like sprites etc.

## Conclusion
* This project taught me how to build a fun and interactive game using Kaboom.js. I also learned many other things like how to plan my time carfully so that I could work on different parts of the game.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
