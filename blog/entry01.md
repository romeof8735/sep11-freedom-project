### Choosing a Tool
The tool that I first chose was called ["Impact"](https://impactjs.com/). I picked this tool because I wanted to make a first person shooter game. This game wouldn't be like any normal shooter game, it would have its own special ability that you can use to take down enemies faster. However while I was thinking of this idea in my head I went to go and tinker with the game code for a little bit, but it was very complicated and I spent around 2-3 hours trying to figure out how it worked. I decided to go ahead and switch to a different tool that was called ["Kaboom"](https://kaboomjs.com/). I switched to Kaboom because their code was much easier to tinker and work on and I took my original idea of making a first person shooter game with special abilites and decided to go with a 2d platformer ganme where u had to complete different levels with your abilities that will help you throughout the way. With Kaboom I am thinking of trying to create my own level
