## Reflection
This is my final blog for the Kaboom game that I have been working on. I am currently as of now done with my game, and I feel proud of how it has turned out. Over the last few months that we have been given this freedom project assignment with picking our own tools such as what I chose Kaboom, I have learned a lot in general on how video games work behind the scenes and the amount of time and coding it takes to not only make the game but also fix a ton of bugs that come naturally along the way. 


One of my best and favorite parts of my project was creating the whole game such as the levels, enemies, and espically the power up 
abilites.

Before I even picked Kaboom I knew that I wanted to make some sort of game to where each level as you go on gets harder and harder. To counter this there would be something in the game that would allow the player to get special abilities to help them advance to the next levels. I am very proud that I was able to do this and didn't change or switch up on my main idea that I wanted to do with my freedom project. 

## Reflection of the Challenges
The most challenging part was getting the different mechanics to work together like the powerups, level transitions, and collisions. Somethimes I ran into bugs or other things that wouldn't work as intended. But I kept trying different things and seeing different results each time which allowed for me to figure out how to fix them. These challenges have taught me that coding isn't always going to work right the first time like how it usually does with HTML, but its about how we deal with these problems when the code doesn't work. When the code ends up not working I learned how to think like a developer and figure out which parts of the code were causing errors and which parts wasn't by using the importance of testing your game as you code along. 

## Engineering Desgin Process
At the start of learning my tool I decided to do a lot of tinkering and seeing what I could do with Kaboom. Thats when I saw that you could make a platformer game, so I decded that this would be the perfect thing for the game that I'm trying to create. While in the playground area of Kaboom I played through their like template of a platformer game and I imagined what my game would be like if I could make it like this template and decided to start trying. 

## Skills
The skills that I have improved on while working on this project was mainly Problem Decompostion and Debugging.

### Problem Decomposition
When I first started my game I broke the pieces of the game down to what I needed to do first and then what I could do after. The first thing that I had to do was create the level for all of the sprites to be on. Then I created and added to sprites into the game followed by the powerup apples but with no abilities yet. After I created the sprites I would go back to working on the levels and making. After completing the levels I would start to work on making the apples abilites to fit the map, such as the really high areas would allow to make a apple that gives you boosted jump force, the farther jumps would allow my to create a apple that made you bigger so that your hitbox can stretch out to those farther jumps, and the longer part of the map would allow for me to make a apple that gave you super speed.

### Debugging
I was faced with many bugs while creating my game such as the apples abilites not going away if you entered the portal with the effects still active making them stack when you touched another of the same apple. Instead of giving up I decided to change my code around and after each little change in code I would restart my game to see if the bug still occured, and I kept doing that until I fainlly figured out what was cause for this bug.
