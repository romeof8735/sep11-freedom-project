### Learning Kaboom 
So far I have been tinkering with Kaboom in my ide for a little bit and so far I have learned many things. I have learned things like how to use a `loader`, `text`, `speed`, and `player movement`. While I was learning on make the `loader` in the Kaboom I used their tutorial to help me, and it was pretty similar to add to my game. The player movement and speed that I used in my game looks like this: ![image alt](https://github.com/romeof8735/sep11-freedom-project/blob/7c3abb305622389c2d5268aa98d25cb5ede3fb41/Screen%20recording%202024-12-14%209.43.56%20PM.gif)


The loader in my game looks like this. After I learn a few more things I am planing on making a platformer, where I can use these elements that I have learned so far and use them insisde of the platformer game.
